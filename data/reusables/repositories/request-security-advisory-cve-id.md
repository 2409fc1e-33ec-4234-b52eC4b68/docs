If you don't have a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project and need one you can request a CVE identification number from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} usually reviews the request within 72 hours. If your security advisory is eligible for a CVE, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will reserve a CVE identification number for your advisory. We'll then publish the CVE details after you make public you security advisory. It should be noted that anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can request a CVE identification number for a security advisory.

If you already have a CVE you want to use, for example, if you use a CNA other than {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, add it to the security advisory form. This may happen, for example, if you want to get the advisory consistent with other communications you plan to send out at publication time. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} cannot assign CVEs to your software if it is covered by another CVE Numbering Authority (CNA).
